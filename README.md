# EverestNER Benchmark Data Sets for Nepali Named Entity Recognition
We have created the largest NER benchmark data set for Nepali available to date. It covers five named entities - Person Name, Location, Organization, Event and Date. 

The EverestNER data set is divided into train (EverestNER-train) and test (EverestNER-test) sets. Each data set has character level annotations (-char.txt) as well as token level annotations (-bio.txt). Please read our paper to get more information on this.
